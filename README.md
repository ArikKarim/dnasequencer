# üß¨ replitranscriptilator

You've reached the README.md of Arik Karim's DNA replitranscriptilator (replication-transcription-translation) tool! *Thanks for stopping by!*

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Function

I made this Python console-based program back in 9th grade to automate the replication-transcription-translation processes involved in DNA sequencing. It functions as a calculator where you input a string of DNA triplets, outputting the associated mRNA codon, tRNA anticodon, and amino acids! Load the main.py file into a Python IDE or programming environment with a console to test the program.
