# DNA Sequencer

## Run Instructions
Import or copy/paste `main.py` into the IDE of your choice in a Python environment. Hit 'Run', input a combination of of adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T) DNA triplets into the console, and hit 'Enter' to output the associated mRNA codon, tRNA anticodon, and amino acids. Useful for processing large datasets of DNA triplets in a snap.
